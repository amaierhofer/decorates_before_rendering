# DecoratesBeforeRendering

A small add-on for [Draper](http://github.com/jcasimir/draper) that automatically decorates
specified controller instance variables before rendering. Currently only works on objects
that respond to ```model_name````, but this could easily be expanded upon.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'decorates_before_rendering'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install decorates_before_rendering

## Usage

See ```lib/decorates_before_rendering.rb``` for usage instructions.
